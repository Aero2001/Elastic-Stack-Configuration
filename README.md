# Project-1-Cybersecurity-Bootcamp-ELK
This is the first project I completed in my cybersecurity boot-camp course. This showcases the process and files used in order to create a webserver running DVWA on a docker container configured using Ansible with all webservers being able to communicate to an ELK server.
